        <h2> ABOUT US</h2>
        <p class="text"> Foody Eats is driven by the passion to solve issues that matter. It’s the perfect mix of
            generational
            farmers and passionate entrepreneurs harnessing expertise in agriculture, environment and supply chain
            backed by technology to solve issues that matter.
            Encouraged to positively contribute to the society, our team has studied the pain points of farmers,
            distributors and consumers. With technological accessibility at a peak we found this to be the perfect time
            to combine grass root experience and professional learning to find solutions for people beyond our farms and
            friends.
            With our experience of managing supply chains for some of the largest companies in the world, we aim to
            automate and optimize the agri supply chain of Pakistan. This automation enables us to bring the freshest
            and the cleanest food items to our customer at the lowest price. This optimization reduces waste and brings
            value to both the producer and the consumer.Our launch has been two years in the making while working with a
            handful of farmers supplying directly to
            B2B customers. In 2017, we were successful in empowering our first set of farmers by helping increase crop
            yields, high value crop allocation and farmer incomes.

            
              <h3 >Our Vision</h3>

               <p> We hope to revolutionize the fresh produce supply chain - encouraging farmers to adopt sustainable
                    practices
                    while providing our customers with everyday essentials fresh from the farm.</p>
